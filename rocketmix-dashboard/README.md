This project is a dashboard for Spring actuator endpoints. It is build with babel and packaged with webpack to produce a bundle.js file made to be integrated directly in an HTML webpage. 

How to build and run it :
-------------------------

Once you got the project, make 'npm install' to install locally all javascript modules it depends on. Then, just run 'npm start' to run it. It will be served locally on port 3000 by webpack-dev-server with a built-in livereload ('watch' set to 'true' in webpack config).
